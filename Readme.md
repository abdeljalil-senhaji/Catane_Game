# Catane Game

[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Documentation-github-brightgreen.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/abdeljalil-senhaji/Vampire_Game)


In Vampire, players assume the personas of vampires — the immortal bloodsuckers of the horror genre — and guide these characters through a world virtually identical to our own. But these aren’t quite the vam- pires you might know from Dracula or Twilight. The vampires that exist now — or Kindred, or Cainites, as they commonly call themselves — are both similar to and different from what we might expect. In many ways, vampires resemble the familiar monsters of myth,cinema, folklore, and fiction. However — as many an intrepid vampire-hunter has learned to his sorrow — not all of the stories about vampires are true.
